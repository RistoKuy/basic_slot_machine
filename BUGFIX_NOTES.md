# Bug Fix: Game Not Loading

## Problem
After the refactoring to use `controller.js`, the game would not initialize and remained static/unplayable.

## Root Cause
The issue was a **timing conflict** between two `DOMContentLoaded` event listeners:

1. **`controller.js`**: Waited for DOM to load, then dynamically loaded game mechanics modules
2. **`GameController.js`**: Had its own `DOMContentLoaded` event listener to initialize the game

### The Issue:
When `controller.js` dynamically loads the game mechanics scripts, the DOM is **already loaded**. This means when `GameController.js` is loaded, its `DOMContentLoaded` event listener is registered, but the event has already fired, so the initialization code **never runs**.

### Timeline of Events:
```
1. Browser loads index.html
2. DOM loads
3. DOMContentLoaded event fires
4. controller.js runs and starts loading modules
5. GameController.js is loaded dynamically
6. GameController.js tries to listen for DOMContentLoaded
7. ❌ DOMContentLoaded already fired - listener never triggers
8. Game never initializes
```

## Solution
Moved the game initialization logic from `GameController.js` into `controller.js`:

### Changes Made:

#### 1. **Modified `controller.js`**
- Moved the game initialization code (creating SlotMachine, ProgressiveJackpot, GameStats) directly into the `initializeGame()` function
- This ensures initialization happens immediately after all modules are loaded
- Added success logging for better debugging

#### 2. **Modified `GameController.js`**
- Removed the `DOMContentLoaded` event listener and all initialization code
- Now only exports the `SlotMachine` class
- The class is instantiated by `controller.js` after all dependencies are loaded

## Code Changes

### Before (GameController.js):
```javascript
class SlotMachine {
    // ... class definition ...
}

// Game Initialization and Event Handlers
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    const slotMachine = new SlotMachine();
    const progressiveJackpot = new ProgressiveJackpot(slotMachine);
    const gameStats = new GameStats();
    // ... initialization code ...
});
```

### After (GameController.js):
```javascript
class SlotMachine {
    // ... class definition ...
}
// No event listener - just the class definition
```

### After (controller.js):
```javascript
async function initializeGame() {
    try {
        await loadGameMechanics();
        
        // Manually trigger game initialization
        const slotMachine = new SlotMachine();
        const progressiveJackpot = new ProgressiveJackpot(slotMachine);
        const gameStats = new GameStats();
        // ... initialization code ...
        
        console.log('✓ Game initialized successfully!');
    } catch (error) {
        // Error handling...
    }
}
```

## Result
✅ Game now initializes correctly after all modules are loaded
✅ No timing conflicts between event listeners
✅ Clear console logging shows the loading progress
✅ Game is fully playable

## Lessons Learned
When dynamically loading scripts that contain `DOMContentLoaded` listeners:
- The event may have already fired by the time the script loads
- Always check `document.readyState` or handle initialization manually
- Centralize initialization logic in the loader/controller
- Use console logs to track module loading and initialization

## Testing
To verify the fix works:
1. Open browser console
2. Load the game
3. You should see:
   ```
   Loading game mechanics...
   ✓ Loaded: StatusEffects.js
   ✓ Loaded: BettingSystem.js
   ✓ Loaded: GameLogic.js
   ✓ Loaded: GameFeatures.js
   ✓ Loaded: GameController.js
   ✓ All game mechanics loaded successfully!
   Game mechanics loaded. Initializing game...
   ✓ Game initialized successfully!
   ```
4. Game should be fully interactive and playable
