## 🎯 Your First 5 Minutes

### Step 1: Understand Your Credits (Top of screen)
```
CREDITS: 100  |  BET: 10
```
- **CREDITS**: How much money you have
- **BET**: How much you're betting per spin
- You start with **100 credits**
- Each spin costs your current **BET** amount

### Step 2: Learn the Payouts
Look at the **PAYTABLE** at the bottom:
- **3 matching symbols** = BIG WIN! (20x to 500x)
- **2 matching symbols** = Small win (1.5x your bet)
- **0 matching symbols** = Get half your bet back

💡 **Key Point**: You NEVER lose everything! Always get something back.

### Step 3: Try Your First Spins
1. Click `🎰 SPIN 🎰` or press **Spacebar**
2. Watch the reels spin (super cool animation!)
3. See your win amount below the reels
4. Your credits update automatically

🎁 **Bonus**: Your first 3 spins have **BOOSTED** win chances!

### Step 4: Adjust Your Bet
- `BET +` / `BET -`: Change by 5 credits
- `BET +10x` / `BET -10x`: Smart betting (multiply/divide by 10)
- **Minimum**: 5 credits
- **Maximum**: All your credits (but risky!)

### Step 5: Watch for Status Effects

#### 💙 **Blue Glow = Pity Status**
When your credits drop below 50:
- You get BONUS win chances!
- The game helps you recover
- Watch the blue border pulse

#### 👑 **Purple Glow = Privilege Status**  
When you're on a winning streak with 1000+ credits:
- You get BONUS win chances
- BUT you pay a 10% tax on wins
- High risk, high reward!

## ⚠️ Common Questions

### "I ran out of credits, what now?"
Game over! But you can click **RESTART GAME** to start fresh with 100 credits.

### "What does the blue/purple border mean?"
That's a **Status Effect**:
- **Blue** = Pity Status (helping you when low on credits)
- **Purple** = Privilege Status (challenging you when rich)

### "I got 2 matching symbols, is that good?"
Yes! You get **150%** of your bet back. It's a small win.

### "Why didn't I get a jackpot with 3 symbols?"
Jackpots are **probability-based** (normally 1% chance). You need both:
1. Three matching symbols
2. Win the probability roll

The better your status effects and bet, the higher your jackpot chance!

### "Can I lose all my credits in one spin?"
Nope! Even with zero matches, you get **50% of your bet back**. You can only run out gradually.
