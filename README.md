# Basic Slot Machine

A web-based slot machine game built with vanilla JavaScript.

## Architecture

The codebase has been refactored from a single monolithic `controller.js` (500+ lines) into a modular architecture with separate responsibilities:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each system has its own dedicated file
- **Maintainability**: Easier to find, modify, and debug specific features  
- **Scalability**: Simple to add new features without bloating existing files
- **Code Organization**: Logical grouping of related functionality

## Game Rules

- **3 matching symbols**: Jackpot (probability-based payout)
- **2 matching symbols**: 150% of bet returned
- **No matches**: 50% of bet returned
- **Minimum bet**: 5 credits
- **Starting credits**: 100

## Status Effects

### üíô Pity Status
- **Activation**: After losing 4 times in a row AND having <50 credits
- **Effect**: Every 10 credits bet increases:
  - Jackpot chance by +1%
  - Two-match chance by +5%

### üëë Privilege Status
